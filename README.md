# Human Resources Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a human resources dataset to extract valuable insights and trends that can aid decision-making within an organization. The analysis follows a structured approach, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), forecasting, and dashboard visualization.

## Project Timeline
### **Week 1: Data Model, Cleaning, and Preprocessing**
- **Tasks:**
  - Build a structured data model.
  - Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Tools:**
  - SQL
  - Python (pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Deliverables:**
  - Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
  - Data preprocessing notebook.

### **Week 2: Analysis Questions Phase**
- **Tasks:**
  - Determine key analysis questions relevant to HR decision-making.
  - Identify relationships and patterns in the dataset (e.g., employee satisfaction vs. age).
- **Tools:**
  - SQL
  - Python (pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Deliverables:**
  - A structured set of analysis questions.

### **Week 3: Forecasting Questions Phase**
- **Tasks:**
  - Define forecasting questions based on trends in the dataset.
  - Implement forecasting models to predict future trends.
- **Tools:**
  - Python (scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Deliverables:**
  - Visualization plots answering forecasting questions.

### **Week 4: Visualization Dashboard and Final Presentation**
- **Tasks:**
  - Build a Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights.
  - Prepare a final report summarizing the findings.
  - Create a presentation covering data analysis, forecasting, and conclusions.
- **Tools:**
  - SQL
  - Python (pandas, Matplotlib)
  - Tableau
- **Deliverables:**
  - Interactive visualization dashboard.
  - Final report and presentation.
